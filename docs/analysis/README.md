## Technology Stack

Based on `technical-requirements.md` from reference project:

### Backend
- **Java 17** (LTS)
- **Spring Boot 3.x**
- **Spring Security** (authentication & authorization)
- **Hibernate / JPA** (ORM)
- **PostgreSQL 15+** (database)
- **Flyway** (database migrations)
- **Maven** (build tool)

### Frontend
- **Angular 17+**
- **TypeScript**
- **Angular Material** or **PrimeNG** (UI components)
- **RxJS** (reactive programming)

### Infrastructure
- **Docker** (containerization)
- **Docker Compose** (orchestration)
- **Nginx** (reverse proxy)

### Architecture
- **Mono-repository** (backend + frontend + docs)
- **API-First Design** (RESTful API)
- **Microservices-ready** (future consideration)

---

## Development Phases

### ✅ Phase 0: Analysis & Design (Current)
- Data model definition
- Use case identification
- User story creation
- Technical architecture review

### 📋 Phase 1: Foundation (Q1 2024)
**Scope**:
- User authentication (ADMIN role only)
- Building CRUD operations
- Housing Unit CRUD operations
- Room management
- PEB score history
- Rent history
- Water meter history
- Basic Angular UI

**Deliverables**:
- Working application with core features
- Docker deployment
- Basic documentation

### 📋 Phase 2: Tenant & Financial (Q2-Q3 2024)
**Scope** (from backlog):
- Tenant management
- Lease contracts
- Payment tracking
- Additional utility meters (electricity, gas, heating)
- Role expansion (PROPERTY_MANAGER, ACCOUNTANT)
- OAuth 2.0 migration

### 📋 Phase 3: Operations (Q4 2024 - Q1 2025)
**Scope** (from backlog):
- Maintenance management
- Document management
- Financial reporting
- Dashboard
- Email notifications

### 📋 Phase 4: Self-Service (Q2-Q3 2025)
**Scope** (from backlog):

## Design Principles

### 1. API-First
The REST API is the primary interface. Any frontend (Angular, React, mobile) can consume it.

### 2. Historization
Time-sensitive data (PEB, rent, meters) uses history tables with append-only pattern.

### 3. Simplicity First
Start simple (single owner, single role). Add complexity incrementally based on real needs.

### 4. Data Integrity
Use database constraints, foreign keys, and application-level validation.

### 5. Audit Trail
Track who created/modified data with timestamps and user references.

## Business Rules Summary

### Building
- Must have complete address
- Owner is optional
- Can contain multiple housing units
- Deletion cascades to units and all related data

### Housing Unit
- Must belong to a building
- Unit number unique within building
- Inherits owner from building unless overridden
- Total surface can be calculated or manually entered
- Can have terrace and/or garden with orientations

### Room
- Must belong to housing unit
- Surface is approximate (not legally binding)
- Sum of room surfaces helps calculate unit surface

### PEB Score
- Append-only history table
- Most recent score_date = current score
- Score values: A++ to G

### Rent
- Append-only history table
- Current rent has effective_to = NULL
- Historical rents have explicit date ranges
- Indicative only (not actual tenant payments)

### Water Meter
- Append-only history table
- Current meter has removal_date = NULL
- Meter periods don't overlap
